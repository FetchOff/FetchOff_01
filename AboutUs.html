        <!-- <h2>AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h2>
        <P>HI!, MY NAME IS DAVID CHANEY, FOUNDER OF FETCH OFF EVENT RECYCLING.</P> -->

        <P>The Goal is to FETCH as many recycling pieces that could potentially harm the environment. There are many different ways we could re-use Plastic Bottles, Cans, Cardboard, Paper, Aluminum, Loose Plastic. *LITTERING is ILEGAL*. Most of the trash ends up in the oceans, rivers, lakes and green areas. Polluting the environment and harming wild life is not how we should live comfortably.</P>
